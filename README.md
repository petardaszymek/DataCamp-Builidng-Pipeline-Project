# DataCamp-Builidng-Pipeline-Project

This Python script performs a data processing pipeline for grocery sales data, focusing on extraction, cleaning, and aggregation. Key features include:

- **Extraction:** Merges data from two sources based on the "index" column using `pandas`.
- **Transformation:** Fills missing values, converts date formats, and filters data.
- **Aggregation:** Calculates average monthly sales.
- **Loading:** Saves cleaned and aggregated data to CSV files.

## Usage

1. Ensure dependencies (`pandas`) are installed.
2. Execute the script with input data (e.g., grocery_sales, extra_data.parquet).
3. Review `clean_data.csv` and `agg_data.csv` for insights.

## Customization

Adaptable for various data sets and requirements.
